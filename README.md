AI & ML Student interested in data science.

Junior programmer with passion for design, music and really any kind of art, including math, and sometimes, although rarely, post-post modern irony.

Currently participating in global capitalism, but I mostly like [construction and management simulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction_and_management_simulation), [old-school RPGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokémon_(video_game_series)#First_generation_(1996–1999)) and [4X-games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4X). Oh and I guess Binance is a game by now.

<span style="font-family:Georgia;">Shoutout to my man Euler and my homeboy Aristotle. Wittgenstein real MVP. Socrates was a fucking asshole. Well, I guess most guys throughout history were assholes. Carl Jung was kinda cool though. One luv M.C. Escher, Wagner and Edvard Grieg. Pollock and Warhol real incel losers.</span>
